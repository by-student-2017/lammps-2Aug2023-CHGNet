Customized LAMMPS(2Aug2023) for Neural Network Potential, by AdvanceSoft Corp. <http://www.advancesoft.jp>.

This is a prototype that can output MAGMOM (magnetic moment) as Lammps' q instead of CHGNet. I don't have the capacity to convert MAGMOM values ​​to electric charge (q), so I'm leaving it as it is. Please be careful.
