Note
- First-principles calculations show that the formation energy of graphitic nitrogen is approximately 0.5 eV.
- Since 1 eV = approximately 10,000 K, a simulation performed at around 5,000 K allows us to observe the reaction according to the Arrhenius or Boltzmann distribution.
- The key to determining the time scale is to infer it from calculations and experimental results for similar systems, and to specify the temperature at which the reaction is likely to occur.
- If raising the temperature destroys all of the structure or causes unnecessary reactions, you can choose to use the NEB method or steadily investigate several structural models (this is more time-consuming but takes less time).
- Similar phenomena have been observed in real time with TEM. However, since the sampling time of TEM is on the order of ms, the energy (temperature) given by TEM is thought to be around 900-1500 K, based on simulations on the order of ps and Î¼s, as predicted by the Boltzmann distribution.
- Considering my experience of seeing amorphous metals grow into crystals, and the fact that the temperature remained at a level where crystalline materials would not evaporate or sublime, 900 - 1500 K is probably not a bad value. Please note that there is a good chance that my estimate is quite wrong.
